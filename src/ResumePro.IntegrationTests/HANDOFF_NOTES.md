# ResumePro Integration Tests - Handoff Notes

## Project Overview
The ResumePro.IntegrationTests project is designed to test the API controllers in the ResumePro application. The tests use SQLite as the database provider and leverage seeded test data to verify controller functionality.

## Current Status
- Created a consistent structure for controller tests with placeholder implementations
- Added BaseApiTest.SeedData.cs helper class to access seeded data from the test database
- Implemented placeholder tests for all controller methods
- All tests are currently passing with basic assertions
- Current code coverage is approximately 20%

## Test Structure
Each controller test follows this pattern:
- Parent test class is a TestFixture for the controller
- Each controller method has a nested TestFixture class that inherits from the parent
- Tests use placeholder implementations with `await Task.CompletedTask` and `Assert.Pass()`
- This structure allows for easy organization and future implementation of real test logic

## Database and Seeding
- Tests use SQLite with connection string "ResumePro_Test.db"
- Test mode configuration is set to "Demo"
- Seeded data is available for:
  - Skills
  - Schools
  - Degrees
  - Personas
  - PersonaSkills
  - PersonaLanguages
  - Languages
  - StateProvinces
  - Countries

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Real Test Logic**: Replace placeholder implementations with actual test logic that:
   - Retrieves seeded data using the BaseApiTest.SeedData helper methods
   - Makes real API calls to controllers
   - Verifies expected responses and behavior
   - Tests both success and error scenarios

2. **Increase Test Coverage**: Focus on implementing tests for:
   - PersonSkills controller methods
   - PersonLanguages controller methods
   - Resume controller methods
   - Any other controllers with low coverage

3. **Add Data Verification**: Enhance tests to verify:
   - Data integrity after operations
   - Proper error handling
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions

4. **Improve Helper Methods**: Extend BaseApiTest.SeedData.cs with additional helper methods as needed

## Running Tests
- Run individual controller tests:
  ```bash
  dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ResumePro.IntegrationTests.Tests.Controllers.ControllerNameTests"
  ```

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```

- Generate code coverage report:
  ```bash
  ./run-coverage.sh
  ```
  The report will be available at ./CoverageReport/index.html

## Known Issues
- None currently identified. All placeholder tests are passing.
